excerpt: 'In VI\_ORB\_SLAM, when odometry tracking fails, the system does not immediately attempt relocalization. Instead, it saves the data as local maps and links them using IMU estimates. By integrating accelerometer and gyroscope data from the 6-axis IMU, the relative transformations between maps are derived.'
