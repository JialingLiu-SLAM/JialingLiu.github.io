excerpt: 'Embodied visual exploration is critical for building intelligent visual agents. This paper presents the neural exploration with feature-based visual odometry and tracking-failure-reduction policy (NeOR), a framework for embodied visual exploration that possesses the efficient exploration capabilities of deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based exploration policies and leverages feature-based visual odometry (VO) for more accurate mapping and positioning results. An improved local policy is also proposed to reduce tracking failures of feature-based VO in weakly textured scenes through a refined multi-discrete action space, keyframe fusion, and an auxiliary task. The experimental results demonstrate that NeOR has better mapping and positioning accuracy compared to other entirely learning-based exploration frameworks and improves the robustness of feature-based VO by significantly reducing tracking failures in weakly textured scenes.'
