title: "[CSCWD 2022] TXSLAM: A Monocular Semantic SLAM Tightly Coupled with Planar Text Features"

excerpt: 'We propose a new monocular semantic simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system that tightly couples planar text features. The system treats text features as a plane with rich texture information and semantic information, and more accurate camera pose estimation can be obtained by tightly coupling the semantic plane.'
